Update Jan 22  

# Second run, without muling (except for Spectral Throw)  
Brute: 23 mins  
Marveil: 37 mins  
Died 2 times to Kuduku - Do not fight that boss  
Marveil fight:  
Used Rain of Arrow + Fire Quiver  
Died a couple of times - mostly skill issue.  
Though damage wasn't impressive.  
It was very possible for me to not find that quiver, which would have forced me to farm extra.  
Flame Wall + Spectral Throw might yield more damage anyway.  

# Third run  
Brute: 24 mins  
Marveil: 45 mins  
No fire weapon or quiver.  
Normal weapon felt really weak in prison, died a couple of times and stuck with bad layout reading.  
Marveil fight was only saved with a rare Jade Chopper (had to allocate +30 str to use it).  
It was smoothest fight so far. Improved player skill helped.

Note: level 15 is when Precise Technique become available (almost got to it).  
Since there is no way to force fire damage, I should get Flame Wall after all.  
Also, Vitality aura is probably better. Do not need Precision aura and survivability saves a lot of time.

# why duelist now?
With Phrecia league coming up, I've decided to go with Paladin acendancy to go with Mirror Arrow.  

# First practice run time  
to Cavern WP: 35 minutes  
Marveil kill: 55 minutes  

Considering Templar + Witch run took 60 minutes just to get to Cavern WP, this isn't the worst time ever, but can be improved by huge amount.  

# Skill gem choices  
1. Probably want to grab at least Flame Wall  
Not absolutely needed, but safer to get in case fire damage weapon doesn't drop.  
Fire Mastery is INSANE damage.  
![fire mastery for 100% dmg inc](<../../assets/スクリーンショット 2026-01-21 064852.png>)  
This mastery + Spectral Throw + Fmale Wall combined just melts merveil.  
For bow, Fire Arrow Quiver that drops from level 9 can be used instead. 
Quiver probably drops before Merveil so maybe can save time by not getting Fame Wall?   

2. Holy Flame Totem  
First run had this gem.  
I was hoping this would taunt the boss enough, but that doesn't happen sufficiently often.  
Nice for clear, but for bossing I don't want to be using this.  
Will try a run without.  

3. Precision vs Vitality Aura  
Without any extra source of accuracy or life, it doesn't seem like Precision is needed to activate Precise Technique.  
Can opt for Vitality.  
But for endgame Precision has likely to have higher importance, might as well just go with Precision here?  

# Notes  

Managing 4 skills was a bit awkward. If I'm doing that, preparing careful keybinds would be good.
