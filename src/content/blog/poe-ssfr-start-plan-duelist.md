# why duelist now?
With Phrecia league coming up, I've decided to go with Paladin acendancy to go with Mirror Arrow.  

# First practice run time  
to Cavern WP: 35 minutes  
Marveil kill: 55 minutes  

Considering Templar + Witch run took 60 minutes just to get to Cavern WP, this isn't the worst time ever, but can be improved by huge amount.  

# Skill gem choices  
1. Probably want to grab at least Flame Wall  
Not absolutely needed, but safer to get in case fire damage weapon doesn't drop.  
Fire Mastery is INSANE damage.  
![fire mastery for 100% dmg inc](<../../assets/スクリーンショット 2026-01-21 064852.png>)  
This mastery + Spectral Throw + Fmale Wall combined just melts merveil.  
For bow, Fire Arrow Quiver that drops from level 9 can be used instead. 
Quiver probably drops before Merveil so maybe can save time by not getting Fame Wall?   

2. Holy Flame Totem  
First run had this gem.  
I was hoping this would taunt the boss enough, but that doesn't happen sufficiently often.  
Nice for clear, but for bossing I don't want to be using this.  
Will try a run without.  

3. Precision vs Vitality Aura  
Without any extra source of accuracy or life, it doesn't seem like Precision is needed to activate Precise Technique.  
Can opt for Vitality.  
But for endgame Precision has likely to have higher importance, might as well just go with Precision here?  

# Notes  

Managing 4 skills was a bit awkward. If I'm doing that, preparing careful keybinds would be good.
