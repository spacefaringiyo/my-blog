Update Jan 22  

# Second run, without muling (except for Spectral Throw)  
Brute: 23 mins  
Marveil: 37 mins  

Died 2 times to Kuduku - Do not fight that boss  
Marveil fight:  
Used Rain of Arrow + Fire Quiver  
Died a couple of times - mostly skill issue.  
Though damage wasn't impressive.  
It was very possible for me to not find that quiver, which would have forced me to farm extra.  
Flame Wall + Spectral Throw might yield more damage anyway.  

# Third run  
Brute: 24 mins  
Marveil: 45 mins  

No fire weapon or quiver.  
Normal weapon felt really weak in prison, died a couple of times and stuck with bad layout reading.  
Marveil fight was only saved with a rare Jade Chopper (had to allocate +30 str to use it).  
It was smoothest fight so far. Improved player skill helped.

Note: level 15 is when Precise Technique become available (almost got to it).  
Since there is no way to force fire damage, I should get Flame Wall after all.  
Also, Vitality aura is probably better. Do not need Precision aura and survivability saves a lot of time.  
Didn't even drop a bow as far as I'm aware.  

# Fourth run  
Brute: 23 mins  
Marveil: 44 mins + 5 mins (Flame Wall)  

2nd Quicksilver flask was not needed / I couldn't utilized it well.  
Had difficulties utilizing both Decoy Totem and Flame Wall on bosses.  
Missed waypoint on Shipyard and didn't portal out.  
Died many times to exploding sea monsters. Which probably could've mitigated a little if I used armour chest piece instead of Evasion + Energy Shield Chest.  
Did a lot of damage against Marveil even with mediocre 24% phys inc 2 hand weapon.  

Major problems are:  
Skill binds and gameplay  
Was rushing too much into deaths  
  
Flame Wall is most likely worth it.  
Just need to improve mechanics.  

# Fifth run  
Brute: 23 mins  
Marveil: 39 mins  
ST mule only.  

Reletively smooth run.  
Low level base flat (low) damage weapon carried.  
I can shave more minutes fighting less, as I was over leveled for Marveil, assuming I don't go for Precise Technique.  

# Sixth run  
Brute: 21 mins  
Marveil: 33 mins  
Act 2 finish: 1h7m (insane weapon rng)  

# Seventh run
Brute: 23 mins  
Marveil: 37 mins  
Act 2 finish: 1h20m  

# Eighth run  
Brute: 21 mins  
Marveil: 38 mins  
Act 2 finish: 1h15m (moderately insane weapon rng)  

Setup conclusion after 8 runs:  
Flame Wall is not needed.  
It only takes at minimum a level 8 2 handed weapon and nothing more.  
I should be getting Fire damage most runs sometimes early act 2.  
In most runs, I'm getting some sort of good rng, if I actually used them all, most of the runs above could've been faster.  

Micro optimizations:  
Inventory space management vs Redundancy  
I was often struggling to find green sockets.  
Not having back up plan sometimes meant that I couldn't wear an upgrade.  

Other notes:  
Good one hander base + Shield is a good option.  
Have a shield in the inventory.

# why duelist now?
With Phrecia league coming up, I've decided to go with Paladin acendancy to go with Mirror Arrow.  

# First practice run time  
to Cavern WP: 35 minutes  
Marveil kill: 55 minutes  

Considering Templar + Witch run took 60 minutes just to get to Cavern WP, this isn't the worst time ever, but can be improved by huge amount.  

# Skill gem choices  
1. Probably want to grab at least Flame Wall  
Not absolutely needed, but safer to get in case fire damage weapon doesn't drop.  
Fire Mastery is INSANE damage.  
![fire mastery for 100% dmg inc](<../../assets/スクリーンショット 2026-01-21 064852.png>)  
This mastery + Spectral Throw + Fmale Wall combined just melts merveil.  
For bow, Fire Arrow Quiver that drops from level 9 can be used instead. 
Quiver probably drops before Merveil so maybe can save time by not getting Fame Wall?   

2. Holy Flame Totem  
First run had this gem.  
I was hoping this would taunt the boss enough, but that doesn't happen sufficiently often.  
Nice for clear, but for bossing I don't want to be using this.  
Will try a run without.  

3. Precision vs Vitality Aura  
Without any extra source of accuracy or life, it doesn't seem like Precision is needed to activate Precise Technique.  
Can opt for Vitality.  
But for endgame Precision has likely to have higher importance, might as well just go with Precision here?  

# Notes  

Managing 4 skills was a bit awkward. If I'm doing that, preparing careful keybinds would be good.
