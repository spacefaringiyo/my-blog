Community feels like a living organism.  
I see it kind of like fractal in nature.  
Its operation isn't simple sum of positive or negative values.  
It feels more like cascading multiplication.  
These (very) naive attempt at explaining it is just to say that how community works from the (very) limited experience I've had seems complex and not prone to simple manipulation in one way or the other.  
I knew enough before being part of the community I'm in now, that that is the case. So I didn't try to force it to "be more alive" or even be alive at all.  
But that doesn't mean that my inputs (or anyone else's) aren't consequential. They very much are. In high swing volatile ways.  
It's interesting how hot or cold does the organism get. I'm also intrigued by its surprising resilience.  
The beast feeds on something, act and grow, and probably eventually get senile and die.  
You can throw heat from outside and prolong its life, or even make it thrive.  
But unless the beast is protected from larger organism/system, if it can't walk by itself, heat dissipates into surrounding environment and the life ahead isn't so long.  

Now, in real world terms, what I'm talking about is this.  
In the community that I'm in (which I happened to have been a "founder" of), although people are clearly fond of the "beast" aka community and do contribute and show affection, it is ultimately trending down in terms of its "aliveness".  
Okay, why is that?  
I said I am a founder of this community, as if it is the detail that barely matters.  
I said that because in my personal sense, that is true. I don't own the community in the sense that you can't really own any natural object, and I certainly doesn't control how alive it is.  
But there is another part to this.  
It's that I still hold the leash and perhaps even keep the community in cage (beast analogy is dragging).  
I do not delegate any tasks (for some good reasons) and I regularly refuse people wanting to really be part of running the group (which is one of the engines that powers the community).  
This works fine. ...as long as I generate enough energy in that particular engine compartment. (now with engine analogy)  
It is becoming more and more challenging keep it up.  
In some weridly intuitive ways, I can sense the latent potential of not holding the engine so close to myself, and I hear the pain of what could come to be but cannot because I don't allow it.  

I have 2 possible paths to go with this situation.  
1. Accept that this engine is mine, and be okay with the fact that the community suffers its health because of this bottleneck.  
2. Open up that engine compartment, deal with whatevevr challenges which might arise because I'm terrible with team work, in the hopes that this will allow "the beast" to take on its foot and start walking again.  

It's important to note, even if the community effectively "dies", the friends and connections made along the way stays ...in some form or the other.  
The beast is not "real", nobody dies. But oh am I attached to many things that aren't "real". (I won't talk about why I'm compelled to put the word in quotation marks here.)  
...
I think it is totally acceptable to think that I created something, people gathered around it, we made something good happen, and it's time to move on because world also moves on.  
But I don't know how I want this to go. Or how this CAN go. Totally possible that I try to make it work and fail epicly. I want it to fail epicly if I'm trying and failing.  

Lastly, to speak more on my personal wishes,  
I don't want to be on a constant tread mill to keep what I care about alive.  
I wish I can create or not create without worrying about ending up not having anything to share the creation with.  
But oh well, isn't this just how the world works? Either you put up something, or be terminated - quit whining and face the reality.  
Whatever the angle is, I'm still not into forcing things. Including my own behavior and state of mind.   
I guess we will see.
