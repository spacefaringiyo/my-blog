# Act 1

#Create
Templar, Witch x2, and Ranger

# Quest gems

Templar:
Kill Hillock - Rolling manga
Mud Flats - Holy Flame Totem
Kill Brutus - Clarity
Cavern of Wrath WP - Absolution

Witch:
Kill Hillock - Raise Zombie
Mud Flats - SRS & Flame Wall
Kill Brutus - Summon Skeletons
Cavern of Wrath WP - Flesh Offering (Can do without)

Ranger(Run this once ready to farm labs):
Mud Flats - Sniper's Mark
Kill Brutus - Mirrow Arrow

# Gem level scaling
Lvl1: 4
Lvl2: 6
Lvl3: 9
Do not level gems until both characters are ready


Step 1
Take Templar to Mud Flats, progress until level 4 
-> do the same with witch

Step 2
Level both characters to level 6
-> Level up gems to 2

Step 3
Level to 9? Undetermined.

Probably should grab skill point quest to farm some exp if we want to reach lvl 9 before Brutus.
