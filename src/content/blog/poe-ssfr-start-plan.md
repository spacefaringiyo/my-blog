# Edit for refinement Jan 21  

Always level to gem req increment for safety and exp efficiency.  
For my speed usually lvl 6 or 9 can be achieved without (much) extra farm.  
First run was roughly 60 minutes.  

# Create

Templar, Witch x2, and Ranger

# Quest gems

Templar:  
Kill Hillock - Rolling manga  
Mud Flats - Holy Flame Totem  
Kill Brutus - Clarity  
Cavern of Wrath WP - Absolution  

Witch:  
Kill Hillock - Raise Zombie  
Mud Flats - SRS
Kill Brutus - Summon Skeletons  
Cavern of Wrath WP - Flesh Offering (Can do without)  

Witch 2:  
Mud Flats - Flame Wall  

Ranger(Run this once ready to farm labs):  
Mud Flats - Sniper's Mark  
Kill Brutus - Mirrow Arrow  

# Gem level scaling

Lvl1: 4  
Lvl2: 6  
Lvl3: 9  
Do not level gems until both characters are ready

# Steps

Step 1  
Get Holy Flame Totem on Templar  
Level Witch to level 6  
-> do the same with Templar  

Step 2  
Level both characters to level 6  
-> Level up gems to 2  

Step 3  
Level to 9? Undetermined.  

Probably should grab skill point quest to farm some exp if we want to reach lvl 9 before Brutus.
