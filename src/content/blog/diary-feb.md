# 2/2  
Decided to have a space for myself for a week, right before a drama hits the community which made me want to comment strongly but is ultimately unrelated to me (so I shouldn't really have commented either way but I know I would've).  
Found a guitar tab on Youtube of Refrain of Memory from Haibane Renmei, an anime I watched last month which became all time favorite and that song is the one I vibe the most... I tried to add it to playlist and then noticed it's already added. Obviously I did not remember a thing. I didn't really recognize which anime the song came from when I added it I'm pretty sure. And still, somehow I picked that particular same song in two different occasions. Youtube algo did the work, and also this tab video comes from the person who also uploaded a lot of tabs for ARIA songs, so there is preference bias beyond my own. I swear this "coincidence" felt super epic when it happened just 20 minutes ago. If I'm being honest it still does feel like that.  
I'm definitely taking these two occurrences as some sort of sign.  
But best explanation and moral of the story here probably is just to slow down, so I notice things more, gravitate towards what I actually enjoy, and choosing that over short term relief of frustrations. After all, I could've still decided to weigh in on the drama, but I didn't.
