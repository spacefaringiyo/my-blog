It is prudent to call out wrong doing and provide consequence for those who did the wrong doings, but also increasing the compassion and mechanical understanding of how mistakes do happen is a good thing.  
For not only that is humane in one axis, we also know that we are going to have greater affordance for facilitation, meaning things we can only manage by punishment now can in the future be dealt with through other means or not happen or be it a problem in the first place.  
In the context of online gaming where fair competition matters, I think whole new paradigm emerges where direct human to human deception is no longer relevant. To put it in non vague terms, we will just play against AI characters, look back in the past and agree that playing against humans was hugely inconvenient and made very little sense other than that was the only option.  
But back to the present day... We care so much about "who do we associate with" and such things while communities becoming larger and larger that if you are earnest and dedicated person you would end up spending all your free time suspecting and investigating your friends/community members. That's a bit ridiculous and obviously unsustainable.  
For those factors, it makes sense to start leaning into more forgiveness, even if today that might seem like a irresponsible attitude or in emotional sense too much hypocracy for us to just accept as positive thing in one go.  
Punishment sucks and we want to advance technologies as fast and as further as possible so that mistakes can only be personal challenge one (and others around) can accept to overcome.  
If you are greedy, you would want to forgive others as that is what you would easily be able to do in richer society/systems.

Decided to have a space for myself for a week, right before a drama hits the community which made me want to comment strongly but is ultimately unrelated to me (so I shouldn't really have commented either way but I know I would've).  
Found a guitar tab on Youtube of Refrain of Memory from Haibane Renmei, an anime I watched last month which became all time favorite and that song is the one I vibe the most... I tried to add it to playlist and then noticed it's already added. Obviously I did not remember a thing. I didn't really recognize which anime the song came from when I added it I'm pretty sure. And still, somehow I picked that particular same song in two different occasions. Youtube algo did the work, and also this tab video comes from the person who also uploaded a lot of tabs for ARIA songs, so there is preference bias beyond my own. I swear this "coincidence" felt super epic when it happened just 20 minutes ago. If I'm being honest it still does feel like that.  
I'm definitely taking these two occurrences as some sort of sign.  
But best explanation and moral of the story here probably is just to slow down, so I notice things more, gravitate towards what I actually enjoy, and choosing that over short term relief of frustrations. After all, I could've still decided to weigh in on the drama, but I didn't.
