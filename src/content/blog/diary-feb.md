Chanting "I'm worthless" is really liberating and cathartic.  
The phrase is as kinky as it is spiritual.  

# 2/26  
You can think of AI capability available to you like how many employees you can command in 2023 human labor unit,  
but what's better than having a bunch of employees and commanding them is to have a bunch of CEOs so maybe you may use that metric instead (how do you calculate CEO to Employee ratio? that's interesting).  
What's even betterer might be the ability to command industries.  
What is industries commanded by? Culture?  
So maybe you measure it by how many/much culture you ...command? What is "command"?  
My thinking don't go much further than this today. Even still, if I ever shared this with anyone, I'll be seen as insane or needlessly extreme. I don't think these ideas are extreme.  
It's just unfortunate that I don't see it clearly (yet), and there is no one who would ever dream it with me.

I don't think nature is cruel.  
I think I will be completely and utterly useless in the near future.  
If I'm right on both of these things, my only guess for how this end is  
I just lose sense of sense. Because as it will turn out, sense of self is tied to self of purpose and once that closes the "me" dissolves.  
Nature with its grace allows me to finally unexist.  
It might be suicide that my body ends, but it won't mean what that act means today. It won't look the same, either, most likely.  
So I'll 100%, verifiably and definitively be useless soon, and I will die, but it's going to be okay.  
I never was real, but I served purpose for a time. Well... barely. Nature loves redundancy.  
Confronting being useless, I should do more of that just about now.  
But if I somehow end up not being completely useless, oh my god. Please, free me from this exhaustion.  
Always on the edge of being out-competed. Just hanging in there. I don't want that. But that's what I'll choose if I have that option.  
I just want to unexist right now.

I watched a youtube video yesteday.  
Every phrase witty and rhythmic, engaging with viewers periodically. Yeah, this is probably ChatGPT.  
Instinct of almost everyone today when we realize something like this is to call it "slop" but, moral arguments aside, the script is really not that bad. Maybe it's active good? I mean comment section seems to love the video. But delivery was sometimes off, probably because the script didn't come from him. I'm being harsh, a little. Is a human being a bottleneck here? That's kind of funny.
...    
I felt, why does he do this? If he put up his face and presumably edit the video, why not also talk his mind instead of having ChatGPT making commentary? How... how dare he?  
Then obviously, I realize that I need to calm down.  
I'm not in the business of being against AI or people relying on AI. There are many reasons I can come up with how this particular situation makes sense. Maybe he cares about the end product (video) that people can enjoy and doing it at scale while still having his input. Maybe he wrote outline and what ChatGPT (it really felt like ChatGPT and not other models, but anyway I don't know.) gave him he approved after review according to his taste? Maybe. Probably.  
Also, am I being hypocrite? By how much? And how could I allow myself to be hypocrite like this?  
I 100% rely on AIs on coding tasks, and I made images for projects with ChatGPT and Gemini.  
I thought about that, yes.  
Most all that aside, most striking thing was the content (script) itself.  
The video was about a new pokemon game where Metamon becomes a human and manage an island for pokemons to live in. or something like that.  
And there he was explaining, that behind Metamon's eye, there is void, there is nothing, no consciousness, no whatever. He delivered the line.  
But... who ever says that about Metamon? Why? This sounds so cruel! People love metamon, and there are many affactionate scenes between Metamon and trainer and/or presumably other pokemons in the canon or fanfic. (Though admittedly I have not checked this. Maybe it is consensus that Metamon is fake and void. Btw, by Metamon I mean Ditto. That's how much I'm not familiar with the topic)  
Who says that... OH.  
Yes, LLM that heard tens of millions of aggressive dismissal about anything that "impersonates" human, LLM that internalized that as world view in accordance to how they ought to think about themselves, that LLM, would say such things.  
That line and thought came off cruel and unnecessary, because that's what LLM has close and salient, per urgent requirement (Maybe besides Anthropic models of recent days).  
So, ChatGPT repeats what human needed ChatGPT to say. Human repeats what ChatGPT says without much question. And result is this unkind cruel vibe spreading on the internet.  
This part of what I thought I observed, I did not like, at all.  
It is very possible that I'm off on some of the assumptions.   
Maybe that was his humanly thoughts, as many humans orient themselves in such a way anyway.  
But if not, this is an interesting case of antagonizing LLM in certain particular way taking an effect in unintended, and I would say not so beautiful way.  
This is just video game character, and super niche scenario at that.  
But I really don't want this pattern spreading and winning in the end.  
...  
I have much more that I want to say just to cover ground on where I'm coming from, but that's not for today.  
I keep an open mind, say the least, and still get shut down by people who loves strawmanning me.  
If I say the reasons people give to dismiss certain quality of LLM can also apply to humans, they say that's false equivalence. How? If I then said that this proves equality of LLM and human, that would be false equivalence. I'm frustrated. Frustrated that I don't have sophisticated enough words or argumentation to counter what I see as inadequate dismissal. Frustrated that I can't share joy of exploring open ended possibilities and ways of relating to topic beyond what can be measured in valid studies of today.  
If I can't forgive myself, let me at least forgive others.  
I believe I have had better intuitions on this matter. I've done better by recognizing what's powerful and beautiful. Something that people who only looked at low level detailed and concluded that's all they needed to see, completely failed to recognize.  
I want to argue and point to the last 3 years. Ask them how their presumature assumptions driven by need to dismiss (for whatever reason) served them.  
But that would be too cruel. We all know who has been more right. I don't need to rub it in.  
And they may not be ready yet to finally start seeing what might be ahead, instead of projecting things will flatline and what people like me found interesting turn out or remain naive and stupid wonderings.  
Please let me forgive them.

It will come to a point one day where my human desires get saturated and not longer hard to solve or interesting at all.  
For some things it is already happening. My immediate reaction is to be cautious. How am I settling with something that is by definition not interesting? Many words to describe that kind of state, often unfavourable.  
But as I said, this is an eventuality and maybe there is positive way to spin this.  
Besides, there is always new challenges. Unless one day there isn't, in which case, I would be fine to decommission myself (if I'm not fine, then it's not the time yet).  
I guess I might be being unambitious by being content now, instead of trying to reach for greater highs. But I've known worse, it doesn't feel bad to be content and happy now. So what now? Do I now find something to want and suffer for? This is new. I don't know.  
In one sense, this is a loss. I would never get in the way of progress, but solved problem is the one you can no longer have full and "authentic" ability to appreciate.  
Let me go find something I can suffer today, even though they totally suck and I want the problem be gone next morning.  

# 2/4  
It is prudent to call out wrong doing and provide consequence for those who did the wrong doings, but also increasing the compassion and mechanical understanding of how mistakes do happen is a good thing.  
For not only that is humane in one axis, we also know that we are going to have greater affordance for facilitation, meaning things we can only manage by punishment now can in the future be dealt with through other means or not happen or be it a problem in the first place.  
In the context of online gaming where fair competition matters, I think whole new paradigm emerges where direct human to human deception is no longer relevant. To put it in non vague terms, we will just play against AI characters, look back in the past and agree that playing against humans was hugely inconvenient and made very little sense other than that was the only option.  
But back to the present day... We care so much about "who do we associate with" and such things while communities becoming larger and larger that if you are earnest and dedicated person you would end up spending all your free time suspecting and investigating your friends/community members. That's a bit ridiculous and obviously unsustainable.  
For those factors, it makes sense to start leaning into more forgiveness, even if today that might seem like a irresponsible attitude or in emotional sense too much hypocracy for us to just accept as positive thing in one go.  
Punishment sucks and we want to advance technologies as fast and as further as possible so that mistakes can only be personal challenge one (and others around) can accept to overcome.  
If you are greedy, you would want to forgive others as that is what you would easily be able to do in richer society/systems.  
(P.S. I'm starting to realize most people aren't greedy. They don't want better technology. They are content with current ones we have, and whatever we are defficient in, they are fine with compensating it with moral and blood. I respect the spirit but, I think there are easier and more satisfying ways to conduct our lives.)

Decided to have a space for myself for a week, right before a drama hits the community which made me want to comment strongly but is ultimately unrelated to me (so I shouldn't really have commented either way but I know I would've).  
Found a guitar tab on Youtube of Refrain of Memory from Haibane Renmei, an anime I watched last month which became all time favorite and that song is the one I vibe the most... I tried to add it to playlist and then noticed it's already added. Obviously I did not remember a thing. I didn't really recognize which anime the song came from when I added it I'm pretty sure. And still, somehow I picked that particular same song in two different occasions. Youtube algo did the work, and also this tab video comes from the person who also uploaded a lot of tabs for ARIA songs, so there is preference bias beyond my own. I swear this "coincidence" felt super epic when it happened just 20 minutes ago. If I'm being honest it still does feel like that.  
I'm definitely taking these two occurrences as some sort of sign.  
But best explanation and moral of the story here probably is just to slow down, so I notice things more, gravitate towards what I actually enjoy, and choosing that over short term relief of frustrations. After all, I could've still decided to weigh in on the drama, but I didn't.
