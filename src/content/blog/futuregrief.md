Last 3 years I had my hope burning regarding AI, seeing potential and what's already there to see, waiting for others too see it as well.  
In the year 2026, people are starting get it. Not all of them, and many still snapshot today's capability/output/sloppiness, ridicule a bit and go back to sleep.  
But undeniably it's already past the point one can dismiss entirely.  
I'm not worried anymore for others not seeing it.  
(and I know, there are others who saw way earlier. I'm late in a sense. Even still, great majority of people had missed the last 3 years.)  
  
Not that I was personally contributing (much) to AI, or that I was evangelizing whole a lot, but to me in my mind, I have fought battles in my mind against the ignorance, disamissals and doubts.  
That brings me to today.  
It is done. The gap between what I see and others see isn't much.  Optimism has won (in this regard).  
Now, I have to find something new.  
...or more that I feel like I have to find something, something that others don't see yet.  
Not even to capitalize on it, although if I could do it I would take the opportunity, because as I follow below, I know it is not the point.  

What comes next is grief.  
Grief of abundance.

First off, almost everyone is a doomer today. Understandably so.  
It is true that more of the population is getting priced out of more and more things.  
It seems like younger generation won't be able to afford a living parent generation could.  
It is possible that we are indeed headed to doom. Into permanent underclass.  
...Just a side note specifically on "permanent underclass". I don't think it is a thing or ever was.  

[If you were farmer serf in the any era earlier than... I don't know, you know history better than I do... then technological advancement moved slower than to make any difference to you in the duration of your life time. In that sense most humans in history lived as permanent underclass.  
But it is not so in the modern era.  At least their children got to live vastly better QoL, and billions lifted out of poverty. (or so is the capitalist talking point, which you may disagree, but at least we can appreciate existence of modern medicine, transportation and warm shower and stuff like that.)]  
Some entity must actively and maliciously oppress you for you to be permanent underclass.  
My assumption is that nobody's got time for that. We all rather share and benefit together. Which doesn't mean equal benefits, but to think a class of people have absolutely no value to be celebrated seems like a physical impossibility.  
But I won't elaborate further. I'm no economist. It's more of a belief thing. So I should rephrase from a physical impossibility to a spiritual impossibility.

This is a dangerous bet.  
Thinking that things go well based on vibes.  
But is it?  
I make whatever financial decision within my own little power I have to make my future life as less shitty as possible, that's given.  
But also I think of the downside of **not being prepared for abandunce.**  

My personal my trajectory was and still not is good, at all.  
To cope, both psychologically and physically, I have adopted to not want certain things.  
Instead of listing what I gave up, let's look at example of ealier generation's habits due to adaptation. Probably easier to see and relate than my own.  

Many of the older generation growing up in severe scarcity, adopted to eat as fast as possible of as calory rich food as possible. That was practical behavior at the time when they were growing up.  
They were so well adapted to that circumstance, they never gave those habits up.  
Needless to say there are a lot of medical donwsides to these habits today where calory is abundant.  

---  

So in short, my worry right now is being so well adjusted to being poor, I won't be able to enjoy life if and when that becomes a possibility.  

But that's not quite. If I'm truly an optimist, I wouldn't worry about this.  
Habits can be changed and heart can be opend up.  
When I worry that I might be too closed up for the blindingly bright future, I'm still in the assumption that things will be harsh just like today.  

So what I'm REALLY worried about is... Wait no, that doesn't work.
Damn it!  Let me worry and be afraid of the future like I want!

Starting over.  

I'm afraid of the future where we all make it,  
almost all the problems of today are solved,  
we still can have things that we can complain about, and certain new serious issue will concern us, BUT  
grieving the loss of "need for survival" that we experienced our entire lives up to that point.  

Things that mattered so much it was almost entire life. Always looming above your head as if it threatens to crush off at any moment.  
Worries and pain you know so intimately.  
You might have done well in your life. You studied hard, worked hard, made informed decisions. You might have achieved a glimpse of making it.  
It might have been thrilling and meaningful.  
You might have utterly convinced yourself you are doomed.  
But abundance, wipes all of that.  As if none of those stories mattered at all.  
You thought *you* deserved a certain level of QoL. Now everyone has it and beyond (and maybe you have a little more than others. w/e)  
You thought *you* fucked up, or someone fucked you up and you'll forever live in the ruins. Now things are eerie easy and everyone is kind.  
It certainly won't erase your past pain and success, but you will realize you were always going to be okay anyway (granted you survived to that point).  
And I don't think relief will negate the grief.  


I don't want to "get ahead" or "escape permanent underclass".  
I'm not interested in "winning" that supposes the existence losers.  
(People who are hoping for relative win might feel the grief the most. And they too will be okay.)  
What I want, is to be prepared for that grief. I can't explain why I want that, given that I do think it's okay to feel it.  
Maybe I'm hoping that by seeing it now and start processing it today, I might be able to help someone. How arrogant and naive, I know.  
Or perhaps I simply don't want to spend last however many years/decades inadvertently hurting others or be hurt by others.  
I'm greedy. I already want to be there. That's more like the reason, probably.   

You can laugh at my corpse if I end up being wrong and froze to death on the stree,  
But I'm afraid I won't be too far off, and I'm worried that you might be wrong.  
I like this asymmetrical bet here.
